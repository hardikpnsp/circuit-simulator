### Inspiration

- [SICP 3.3.4 A Simulation for Digital Circuit](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-22.html#%_sec_3.3.4)
  - The desire to build a simple circuit simulation with three basic gates (AND, OR and NOT) was a byproduct of reading this chapter and doing its exercises.
